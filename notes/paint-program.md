#Anything you can paint, I can program better

Jenn Schiffer, Bocoup and pixel artist

##Mashing up code and tech.

Learning code, using art (of interest to @seb_ly?)

[_var t;_](http://vart.institute) is a project to make art using code. On the way we learn using:

* words
* art
* code

Examples of artists.

###Piet Mondrian

* create a table
* randomly and recursively create tables within
* color some with primary colours

####Lessons learned

* abstract art vs. absract programming
* developer backgrounds vary
* we feel like we need permission - art feels taboo to devs?
* .institute is a weird domain name

###RÃ©ne Magritte

* create 4 cell window, add 4 items and descriptions, one of which matches
* randomness creating surreal labels

###Henri Matisse

Bold colours in paint, blue period with paper cutouts.

* Create a canvas, click to make cutouts
* Makes your own Matisse

###Mary Cassatt

* Upload an image
* Draw on top
* Erase the photo behind the drawing

##Lessons learned

* Most people love art
* Some people like Javascript
* JS is expressive, yet restrictive

What's next? More painters, video art, any stuff that the browser can do.
