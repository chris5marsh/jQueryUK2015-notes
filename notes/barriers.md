#Dismantling the barriers to entry

##Rendering engines

React JS vs. RactiveJS

Competition is veru fierce between these rendering engines, which is good.

##Building stuff with Ractive

Moving from DOM-centric API to a data-centric API.

Building your app becomes easier.

Use MomentJS to render Dates properly.

Code ought to be local to its effects. That way you can avoid zombie code (might be dead, but you don't want to get rid of it).

Similar to web components - creating custom HTML elements that have certain functionality.

Guardian modules built out of HTML and JS. We've taken logic out of the HTML. Ractive allows you to put it back in.

We've lost something by following trends and fads, and using only bleeding-edge tech.

##Disintermediation

The internet has allowed people to become connected in ways they never could before. But you have to go through techies. The demand for software and web apps is high, the need for software developers is through the roof, so we should be happy. But the web should be more democratic.

There's a high barrier to entry. Focus on typing syntactically correct code. People can't get into it without a lot of effort.

Ractive is a way that people can build tools without necessarily understanding the code beneath it.

##Checklist
