#Real-world jQuery

**Live demo**

This is not a practical guide to using jQuery in a real-life situation.

We use jQuery just for modifying the DOM of our web pages. But it can do much more outside the browser window.

Our devices have an impact on out environment. Browsers and the desktop is just the start. The Internet of Things is happening, and we don't know where and how people might be interacting with the web and how the web interacts with the environment.

###Demos

_Battery status_
_Orientation_
_Geolocation_

####Input
_Ambient light_
_Touch_

####Output
_Movement_
_Audio_

####Other things
_Weather_

###Putting things together

Getting location from inputs all together - you can triangulate data points.

Combining real and virtual data

Our technology is machines - we used to store data as soundwaves in metal!

Storing data on discrete machines that can be combined together to make a meaningful whole.

Our environment is interactive! You can affect people using the web: spreading an idea; teaching; providing services.
